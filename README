                   Extdev Restore Tool

This is Ext4 snapshot revert tool.

The implementation of snapshot feature in ext4 filesystem is under progress (at https://github.com/amir73il/ext4-snapshots).

This tool implements feature of 'Revert to specified snapshot' in Ext4 file system.

The tool exports ext4 snapshot to lvm snapshot format. This exported lvm volume is then merged into original ext4 volume by lvm userspace tools. Also, revert can take place without lvm userspace tools. In that case, the tool itself writes all the exceptions directly to the block device. This mode is useful for debugging purposes.

Installation instructions and Usage can be found on Github wiki page.
